# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system that helps you find movies that you might like. It uses a content-based filtering algorithm that compares movies based on their features, such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview. It also has a web interface that lets you search, rate, and get recommendations for movies. 🙌

## 🛠 Installation and Usage

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and some libraries installed. You also need to download two datasets: MovieLens and TMDB. 
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer. 💻
2. Go to the project folder and run `python preprocess.py` to prepare the data. 📊
3. Run `python app.py` to start the web application. 🚀
4. Search for movies, rate them, and get recommendations. 🌟

## 🧠 How it Works

This project uses a content-based filtering algorithm that recommends movies that are similar to the ones that you like or have rated highly. It does this by calculating the similarity between movies based on their features, such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview. It uses the TF-IDF technique to vectorize the features and the cosine similarity to measure the similarity. 📐

The project also uses Flask, a web framework for Python, to create a web interface that connects to the TMDB API to get the details and images of the movies. It also allows you to rate the movies and store your ratings in a dictionary. ⭐
